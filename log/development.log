The binary data at /root/.elm/0.19.0/package/elm/browser/1.0.1/objs.dat is
corrupt.

Elm caches build artifacts in the following directories:

    /root/.elm
    elm-stuff/

Maybe you recently installed a command line tool or editor plugin that messes
with them? They definitely should not be doing that, but you never know! So
maybe try deleting them? Everything will be rebuilt from scratch. This may help
reveal the corrupting influence.

The binary data at /root/.elm/0.19.0/package/elm/browser/1.0.1/objs.dat is
corrupt.

Elm caches build artifacts in the following directories:

    /root/.elm
    elm-stuff/

Maybe you recently installed a command line tool or editor plugin that messes
with them? They definitely should not be doing that, but you never know! So
maybe try deleting them? Everything will be rebuilt from scratch. This may help
reveal the corrupting influence.
