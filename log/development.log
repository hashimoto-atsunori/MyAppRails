The binary data at /root/.elm/0.19.0/package/elm/browser/1.0.1/objs.dat is
corrupt.

Elm caches build artifacts in the following directories:

    /root/.elm
    elm-stuff/

Maybe you recently installed a command line tool or editor plugin that messes
with them? They definitely should not be doing that, but you never know! So
maybe try deleting them? Everything will be rebuilt from scratch. This may help
reveal the corrupting influence.

The binary data at /root/.elm/0.19.0/package/elm/browser/1.0.1/objs.dat is
corrupt.

Elm caches build artifacts in the following directories:

    /root/.elm
    elm-stuff/

Maybe you recently installed a command line tool or editor plugin that messes
with them? They definitely should not be doing that, but you never know! So
maybe try deleting them? Everything will be rebuilt from scratch. This may help
reveal the corrupting influence.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Initialization autoloaded the constants ActionText::ContentHelper and ActionText::TagHelper.

Being able to do this is deprecated. Autoloading during initialization is going
to be an error condition in future versions of Rails.

Reloading does not reboot the application, and therefore code executed during
initialization does not run again. So, if you reload ActionText::ContentHelper, for example,
the expected changes won't be reflected in that stale Module object.

`config.autoloader` is set to `classic`. These autoloaded constants would have been unloaded if `config.autoloader` had been set to `:zeitwerk`.
